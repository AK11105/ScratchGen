# 🎨 ScratchGen — Generative Modeling from Scratch (PyTorch)

> *“Building every generative architecture by hand — to understand, not just to use.”*

---

## 🧩 Overview

**ScratchGen** is a hands-on project for learning and implementing **modern generative models from scratch** using **PyTorch**, organized by historical and conceptual breakthroughs.

Each stage focuses on **rebuilding key generative architectures** — from *VAEs and GANs* to *Diffusion Transformers and Multimodal Generators* — directly from foundational papers.

## 📖 Learning Roadmap

Implementation order, references, datasets, and difficulty ratings are all documented in  
👉 **[`TIMELINE.md`](documentation/TIMELINE.md)**

That file defines the **canonical progression** of ScratchGen — from probabilistic VAEs to modern multimodal diffusion systems.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “Code is the curriculum.”

ScratchGen emphasizes **re-derivation and self-implementation**:
- No prebuilt architectures.  
- Each model trained end-to-end.  
- Minimal dependencies beyond PyTorch and standard math.  
- Strong focus on **intuition → derivation → reproducible results**.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Build intuition for each class of generative model.  
- Understand the *why* behind each innovation.  
- Create a modular foundation to experiment across architectures.  
- Document each implementation with clean notebooks, visuals, and equations.
